# Liana Worshop(s)

The purpose of this repo is to centralize material that can be used during workshop 
about [Liana wallet](https://github.com/wizardsardine/liana).

# Download Liana 'demo' version

During the workshop we will use a 'demo' version on liana:
 - it has a simplified setup: you do not need to run a bitcoin node during the worshop.
 - it use a remote bitcoin regtest: we can mine block on demands, change block time, etc...
 - address/credentials for the remote bitcoin backend are preconfigured, you don't have to care about this.
 - this version can have features that are not yet released but already merged in _master_ branch.
 - use a different datadir than the 'normal' Liana wallet, so we cannot mess up w/ your data if 
   you are already a liana user.

Current binaries for the 'demo' version are:

- [macOS]()
- [Windows]()
- [linux]()

As these binaries are not 'official' signed binaries, some OS can display warnings/errors, you can
find here some informations:

 - [macOS]()
 - [Windows]()

These binaries are build from my [liana_demo](https://github.com/pythcoiner/liana/tree/liana_demo) branch,
but you can build them on your own by following these documents, so you don't have to trust me:

 - [Linux](./build/macos/liana_from_sources.md)
 - [macOS](./build/windows/liana_from_sources.md)
 - [Windows 10](./build/ubuntu/liana_from_sources.md)
